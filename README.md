# Team 11 Post Office React Frontend

The project is compartmentalized in the 'src' directory\
into components and pages. App.js handles the routes and\
index.js is the main point of rendering the entire website.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

These scripts will install the necessary packages from the\
package.json needed to run the project. After installation,\
you can start it on your local host.

**NOTE**
The current version of the project makes HTTP requests to the\
hosted Node server, to develop locally you must change them.
